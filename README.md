# Custom Memory allocator implemented in C

### Progress

`[2024-03-19 | 11:30 AM UTC]`

I suck at C, I suck at low level programming. So I decided to write a custom memory allocator in C. I have no idea what I'm doing, but I'm doing it anyway. Let's see how far I can go.

I was busy with other stuff, so I couldn't work on this project. I'll try to work on it today. I got a really good [blog post](https://arjunsreedharan.org/post/148675821737/memory-allocators-101-write-a-simple-memory) about memory allocation. Its old but still relevant. I'll read it and try to implement some of the stuff mentioned in it.
